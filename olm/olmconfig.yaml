  **About Amazon EventBridge Pipes**


  Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects sources to targets. Pipes are intended for point-to-point integrations between supported [sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-pipes-event-source.html)
  and [targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-pipes-event-target.html), with support for advanced transformations and [enrichment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/pipes-enrichment.html). 
  It reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event-driven architectures, fostering consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. To set up a pipe, you choose the source, 
  add optional filtering, define optional enrichment, and choose the target for the event data.
